## History 

Apple Inc. first released Swift in 2014 as a general-purpose programming language to build applications for iOS and their other operating systems. The language was first devoloped in 2010 by Chris Lattner and his collaboration with other programmers at Apple with the intention to replace Objective-C, Apple's previous programming language, as it was becoming outdated. Core features of Swift were inspired by basic language structures from Objective- C, Ruby, Rust, etc. 

The ultimate goal of Swift is to provide a way for developers to create and maintain correct programs. It's priority is to be a safe and fast programming language. Apart from being used for building Apple related programs, it can also be used  for Linux OS, mobile and desktop applications, cloud services, and server-side programming.
