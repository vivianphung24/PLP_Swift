# Data types and Naming Conventions in Swift 

Swift is a **statically** typed language, which means all the variables, constants, functions must have their types declared in advance.

## Variables vs Constants: 
- **Variables** are a data item whose value can change during the program’s execution. To declare a variable in Swift, use 'var'

- **Notes:** Variable types can not be changed after declaring it in the program. 

*** 

- **Constants** are data items whose value cannot change during the program’s execution. To declare a constant, use 'let'

## Type Safety: 

As mentioned above, since Swift is a strongly typed language, so you can not switch a variable from one data type to another
